## SMS Navigator

During disasters due to the absence of cellular network citizens do not have access to a proper navigation tool when they are stuck in a disaster prone area which they are not familiar with.

## Technologies Used: 

1. Flask -> Server
2. Google maps api's -> to get directions
3. Twilio -> Middleware which provides sms functionality
4. Ngrok -> To make local ip public to everyone
